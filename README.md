# simon_game
The Simon game is a memory challenge featuring four colored buttons, each with a unique light and sound. Players must repeat increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The sequence grows longer with each round, and the game ends if a player makes a mistake. The goal is to achieve the highest score by remembering the longest sequence.
